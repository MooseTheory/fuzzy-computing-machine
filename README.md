# Fuzzy Computing Machine

## Because I'm too lazy to think up my own title

This will be my time-clock vue app.

I'm working to try to make it a progressive web app using [Material Components
for the Web](https://material.io/components/web/)

## Running

1. Check out the code
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn serve`
4. Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Testing

I've been slacking on tests, and I'm not entirely sure yet how to properly test
an application like this.
`vue-cli` should have preconfigured this to use Jest, so tests should be
runnable by executing `yarn test`

## Saving your data

This has not been implemented yet. I need to decide how I wish to store data
before I can begin any work on this.
